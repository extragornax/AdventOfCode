# Aight we gon "emulate" a chip that has 3 instructions:
# 1: add
# 2: multiply
# 99: stop

# these args are just the next three things after the instruction
#  so [1, 1, 2, 0, 99] will add(1) the things at 30 and 20 then store that at 0, then stop
# the output then is: [3, 1, 2, 0, 99] yes this thing overwrites itself
